    <string name="main_about_message">(this minor update just fixes the radar images issue...if you haven\'t upgraded recently, keep reading!)\n\nWelcome to Canada Weather! If you\'re updating, I\'ve got a nice apology message for you below about the broken Environment Canada web links. If you\'re new, welcome to Canada Weather! Ignore that last bit, I promise never goes wrong with this app. Ever. Like, really. But if it does, you can always email me (apps@fishandwhistle.net) and I promise I\'ll be less sarcastic and help you out the best I can.\n\nSo, really, honestly, and truly sorry for the broken link problem, unless you\'re the guy who wrote the rating entitled \"new update sucks\" and gave me a one star rating, that guy can suck it. Also not sorry if you\'re one of the people from Environment Canada that changed the links without letting me know, the next time you do that give me a heads up so the 80,000 or so people who use this app don\'t all get mad at me when I\'m trying to write my thesis proposal and definitely don\'t have time to properly fix it. In case you\'re wondering, my thesis proposal is done, and I now have time to do things like call my mom and clean my bathroom and update this app so the next time a hurricane hits the east coast nobody has to panic. You guys are the best, I\'ll try not to let you down again.</string>
